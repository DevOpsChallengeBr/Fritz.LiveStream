## Interested Guests

I really enjoy pair-programming with other folks, and I'm always looking for more developers to work with.  Whether its
.NET, the web, or some other technology that I'm not familiar with, I'm always interested in collaborating and learning 
new things.

I have received a number of emails from folks that are interested in pair-programming with me on-stream.  
If you have not heard back from me, or are interested in joining me, send an email to stream@jeffreyfritz.com with
your Skype address and topic proposal.  I'll get back to you quickly, and we'll schedule a time to pair-program together.  
Once that process has started, I'll update this page with your name and information about the upcoming stream.
